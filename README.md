A base template for a Choose your Own Adventure game in C# console terminal.

I simply followed a video tutorial well using what I remebered from C++ a couple of years ago. Tutorial in question: C# Fundamentals for Beginners - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QUgvfuKvWU&t

This is a base template for a choose your own adventure story, but I will not be updating this. It is here mostly to share with other people learning.
